        "description": "\nCrypto users, please be cautious and aware of the fraudulent activities carried out by an russian individual named &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; &amp; &quot;icryptofbi&quot; (\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa).\nThis evil person has created multiple fake crypto QR code generator websites, including &quot;xmr-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;xmr-qr-code-generator.com&quot;, and &quot;xmrqrcode.com&quot;.\nThese websites generate QR codes that only direct funds to the scammer's Monero (XMR) address:\n84gHdF7rArqU6e9cbmfPi9iJR2QUU7CoX1XJEvAmQWXmSUkj3C3LVLW3ioHiqNc8iwGPcxCv5Fk13ZY k9fxQFLKuKEW54r6\n\nPlease note that a saved archive of the phishing website containing the fraudster's Monero address can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20231122120748/https://xmr-qr-code.com/8.php\n\nThis phishing scam involves tricking users into sending their cryptocurrency to the scammer's wallet through a QR code, resulting in significant financial losses. The scam operator, known by the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; on websites like GitHub, manipulates and social engineers hosting and domain teams to avoid suspension of these phishing websites. They consistently alter the websites' functionality upon receiving reports and even spam repositories to unblock their malicious domains in order to exploit innocent individuals.\n\nTo protect our community, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and avoid engaging with any QR code generator websites associated with &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. If you come across any instances or suspicious activities related to these scams, please report them immediately.\n\nThe scam involving crypto QR code phishing works as follows: The victim enters the crypto address for which they need a QR code. Then, when they generate the QR code on one of the fraudulent crypto QR code websites, it always displays the same QR code on the final page, containing the fraudster's crypto address. Regardless of which crypto address the victim initially entered, the QR code will always belong to the fraudster, and the victim remains unaware. If someone sends cryptocurrency to the victim's &quot;QR code&quot;, the funds will actually go to the fraudster, as the QR code belongs to them and displays their crypto address.\n\nHis email accounts: The operator is known to use the following email addresses: &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot; and &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot;.\nDue to this abuse, Proton Team has already banned the account &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot;, while the account &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot; remains active.\n\nHis YouTube profile: The YouTube account &quot;https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielenesto&quot;, named Gabriel Enesto (as of 11/25/2023) with Channel-ID: &quot;UCO5q0rVGQs4F4IKnNUbRERg&quot; belongs to the notorious individual known as &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;.\n\nHis Trustpilot profile: Additionally, the Trustpilot account &quot;https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63c0b6a16503ee0012e7c049&quot; also belongs to this despicable character.\nHe utilizes these platforms to defame legitimate companies due to the banning of some of his phishing domains and to sabotage his competitors, driven solely by his insatiable greed.\nAlso, &quot;Cryptofbi007&quot; and &quot;iCryptofbi&quot;, who is named Gabriel Enesto on Trustpilot, changed his country to France in the settings, which is why it shows FR on his clearly fake reviews; however, he is originally from Russia, using this method to manipulate both people and law enforcement agencies.\n\nHis Reddit profile: The fraudster known as &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; went to the extent of creating a public and restricted Reddit group called &quot;qr_code_&quot; to bolster his deceptive crypto QR phishing scam websites in search engine rankings. This group can be seen at &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/qr_code_/&quot;.\nTo further his illicit activities, the fraudster operates under the Reddit username &quot;Itchy-Attention8905&quot;. More information about his activities and profile can be found at &quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Itchy-Attention8905/&quot;.\n\nHis Medium Profile: The Medium profile &quot;@cryptofbi007&quot;, which can be visited at &quot;https://medium.com/@cryptofbi007&quot; (banned), also belongs to the Russian cybercriminal who goes by &quot;icryptofbi&quot; on BitcoinTalk.\n\nHis GitHub profile: Additionally, they can be found on GitHub under the account: https://github.com/cryptofbi007 (banned) , attempting to unblock their phishing domains from phishing warning systems.\nHere are the relevant repositories and issues:\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13139\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13080\nWhile &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; attempted to unblock his phishing domains, the request got declined. Additionally, he changed the titles of the requests on GitHub, making it difficult for potential victims to find the specific request related to unblocking his phishing websites.\n\nI obtained some of his social media accounts by reporting the phishing websites to domain registrars and hosting providers. The Russian individual behind these fraudulent activities went by the names &quot;icryptofbi&quot; or &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. Consequently, I received delayed messages that contained pertinent information from this fraudster.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the operator behind this phishing scam is believed to be Russian and has previously operated fake Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum QR code generator websites such as &quot;Crypto-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;btc-qr-code.se&quot;, and &quot;crypto-qr-code.su&quot;. These websites generate the scammer's Bitcoin address: 18gcvrjDju719nQNXhJxRAaw25Vj6M6i4W\n\nThe phishing websites &quot;usdt-qr.com&quot; and &quot;ltc-qr-code.su&quot; are also owned by the same individual using the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;, indicating a coordinated phishing scheme. Both websites generate the domain holder's (cryptofbi007) USDT address 0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6) and Litecoin address LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ (https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ), further solidifying their association and intention to defraud unsuspecting victims. It is of utmost importance to raise awareness about these fraudulent activities to protect potential targets from falling prey to these scams.\n\nTo aid in identification, please find below a list of all known phishing crypto addresses and domains associated with &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;:\n\nPhishing Crypto Addresses by &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;:\n1.

This person has created multiple fake crypto QR code generator websites, including &quot;xmr-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;xmr-qr-code-generator.com&quot;, and &quot;xmrqrcode.com&quot;. These websites generate QR codes that only direct funds to the scammer's Monero (XMR) address: 84gHdF7rArqU6e9cbmfPi9iJR2QUU7CoX1XJEvAmQWXmSUkj3C3LVLW3ioHiqNc8iwGPcxCv5Fk13ZY k9fxQFLKuKEW54r6.\n\nPlease note that a saved archive of the phishing website containing the fraudster's Monero address can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20231122120748/https://xmr-qr-code.com/8.php\n\nThis phishing scam involves tricking users into sending their cryptocurrency to the scammer's wallet through a QR code, resulting in significant financial losses. The scam operator, known by the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; on websites like GitHub, manipulates and social engineers hosting and domain teams to avoid suspension of these phishing websites. They consistently alter the websites' functionality upon receiving reports and even spam repositories to unblock their malicious domains in order to exploit innocent individuals.\n\nTo protect our community, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and avoid engaging with any QR code generator websites associated with &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;. If you come across any instances or suspicious activities related to these scams, please report them immediately.\n\nThe operator is known to use the following email addresses: &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot; and &quot;[email\u00a0protected]&quot;\nAdditionally, they can be found on GitHub under the account: https://github.com/cryptofbi007 , attempting to unblock their phishing domains from phishing warning systems.\nHere are the relevant repositories and issues:\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13139\nhttps://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13080\nWhile &quot;cryptofbi007&quot; attempted to unblock his phishing domains, the request got declined. Additionally, he changed the titles of the requests on GitHub, making it difficult for potential victims to find the specific request related to unblocking his phishing websites.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the operator behind this phishing scam is believed to be Russian and has previously operated fake Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum QR code generator websites such as &quot;Crypto-qr-code.com&quot;, &quot;btc-qr-code.se&quot;, and &quot;crypto-qr-code.su&quot;. These websites generate the scammer's Bitcoin address: 18gcvrjDju719nQNXhJxRAaw25Vj6M6i4W.\n\nThe phishing websites &quot;usdt-qr.com&quot; and &quot;ltc-qr-code.su&quot; are also owned by the same individual using the pseudonym &quot;cryptofbi007&quot;, indicating a coordinated phishing scheme. Both websites generate the domain holder's (cryptofbi007) USDT address 0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6) and Litecoin address LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ (https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ), further solidifying their association and intention to defraud unsuspecting victims.

This website, operated by an individual based in Russia, has been systematically scamming unsuspecting crypto users and has already swindled over $285,000 as of November 22, 2023 and much more other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\n\nThe evidence of this criminal activity can be verified through the following blockchain link: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1BtMBFxM2diH24hFZTpD5W2aa6F2YEP2NE\nIt is alarming to see the significant financial losses incurred by innocent victims due to the operators' deceitful actions.\n\n\n\n&quot;Exchanger24.org&quot; presents itself as a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange platform, preying on clueless crypto users seeking to make transactions. Once users provide their sensitive information, including their cryptocurrency holdings and personal details, they become vulnerable to identity theft and financial exploitation. The operator of this phishing platform, based on available information, is believed to be located in Russia. It is crucial to exercise caution and raise awareness about this scam to protect individuals from falling victim to their deceptive practices.\n\n\n\nIt has come to our attention that the operators of the phishing website &quot;Exchanger24.org&quot; engage in unethical practices by flagging negative reviews on platforms like Trustpilot and Sitejabber to have them removed. These actions aim to deceive more unsuspecting individuals and increase the chances of successful scams since genuine negative reviews get removed due to the lack of evidence for orders on a completely fake website. A victim has provided a detailed report confirming these actions, which can be found at: https://neomarket.ir/exchanger24-org-is-a-scam/\n\n\n\nThank you for your urgent attention to this matter and don't get scammed by these kind of phishing sites.\n",

You have nothing to worry about,\nbecause I keep my word at all times.\n\nThat is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\ntaking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\nIf you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\n\nBelow is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference:\n12xHi1pTom3od4CUDGMxAcABboM1W8iej1\n\nAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\n\nThe following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\n&gt;&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\nIf I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them)\nyour nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.\n&gt;&gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,\nsince all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.\n\nThings that may be concerning you:\n&gt;&gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.\nBreathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,\nI will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).\n&gt;&gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.\nTrust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!\n\nWe are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner!\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to recommend one more thing... after this you need to make certain you don't get involved in similar kind of unpleasant events anymore!\nMy recommendation - ensure all your passwords are replaced with new ones on a regular basis.\n",

This happened with a company named (Investomania). initially they let me withdraw 600 USD then they got me trapped in the hole since i thought it was real, i kept paying more and more tax and commission until i got run dry. Not until my colleague at work introduced me to her college friend which was now a hacker and does crypto recovery hacks. being skeptical, i contacted him after a few weeks to give it a try and luckily it only took us 2 days to recover everything i lost and he even recovered more from the scammers wallet which i deliberately gave to charity. i am urging anybody here in this comment section, if you have or is going through similar experience, kindly seek professional help if you know a hacker, if you don't then you can contact the guy who assisted me through his contacts bellow \nrefundpolici (at) gmail (dot) com\nWhats app  +1 ( 657 ) 2 6 2  4 4 8 2\n",

The malware I used is driver based and I update its signatures every six hours. Hence your AV is unable to detect its presence.\nI made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and the right half shows the video you were watching at the time.\n\nWith one mouse click, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on your social networks.\nI can also make public all your email correspondence and chat history on the messengers that you use.\n\nIf you don't want this to happen, transfer $770 in Bitcoin equivalent to my Bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, just search &quot;buy bitcoin&quot;).\n\nMy Bitcoin address is: 1AyLWnrMcToF2vBnsE3SzwirXFhuc4jpUC\n\nAfter confirming your payment, I will delete the video immediately, and that's it.

        "description": "\nGreetings!\n\nI have to share bad news with you. Approximately a few months ago, I gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing. After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.\n\nHere is the sequence of events:\n\nSome time ago, I purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to buy it online). I have easily managed to log in to your email account\n\nOne week later, I have already installed the Cobalt Strike &quot;Beacon&quot; on the Operating Systems of all the devices you use to access your email. It was not hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails). All ingenious is simple. :).\n\nThis software provides me with access to all your devices controllers (e.g., your microphone, video camera, and keyboard).\nI have downloaded all your information, data, photos, videos, documents, files, web browsing history to my servers. I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history, and contacts list.\n\nMy virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based) and hence remains invisible for antivirus software. Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter.\n\nWhile gathering information about you, i have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites. You love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure. Well, i have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show how you masturbate and reach orgasms.\n\nIf you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse, and all your videos will be shared with your friends, colleagues, and relatives. Considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch (you perfectly know what I mean), it will cause a real catastrophe for you.\n\nI also have no issue at all with making them available for public access (leaked and exposed all data).\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Under the rules of the law, you face a heavy fine or arrest.\nI guess you don't want that to happen.\n\nLet's settle it this way:\n\nYou transfer $44000 USD to me and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away. After that, we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me. I keep my word.\n\nThat is a fair deal, and the price is relatively low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now. If you don't know how to purchase and transfer Bitcoin - you can use any modern search engine.\n\nYou need to send that amount here Bitcoin wallet:\nbc1qqcxyavu6pjdnjxzjue2x3l85yrjp3nw309mckt\n\n(The price is not negotiable).\nYou have 5 days in order to make the payment from the moment you opened this email.\n\nDo not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server).\nDo not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.\n\nThis is an APT Hacking Group. Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.\nI will monitor your every move until I get paid.\nIf you keep your end of the agreement, you won't hear from me ever again.\n\nEverything will be done fairly!\nOne more thing. Don't get caught in similar kinds of situations anymore in the future!\nMy advice: keep changing all your passwords frequently.\n",

You have nothing to worry about,\nbecause I keep my word at all times.\n\nThat is indeed a beneficial bargain that comes with a relatively reduced price,\ntaking into consideration that your profile and traffic were under close monitoring during a long time frame.\nIf you are still unclear regarding how to buy and perform transactions with bitcoins - everything is available online.\n\nBelow is my bitcoin wallet for your further reference: 1BkFNE2b5oTpZLxeu4jRJbypJCMAxSt5Ug\n\nAll you have is 48 hours and the countdown begins once this email is opened (in other words 2 days).\n\nThe following list includes things you should remember and avoid doing:\n&gt; There's no point to try replying my email (since this email and return address were created inside your inbox).\n&gt; There's no point in calling police or any other types of security services either. Furthermore, don't you dare sharing this info with any of your friends.\nIf I discover that (taking into consideration my skills, it will be really simple, because I control all your systems and continuously monitor them)\nyour nasty clip will be shared with public straight away.\n&gt; There's no point in looking for me too - it won't result in any success. Transactions with cryptocurrency are completely anonymous and untraceable.\n&gt; There's no point in reinstalling your OS on devices or trying to throw them away. That won't solve the issue,\nsince all clips with you as main character are already uploaded on remote servers.\n\nThings that may be concerning you:\n&gt; That funds transfer won't be delivered to me.\nBreathe out, I can track down everything right away, so once funds transfer is finished,\nI will know for sure, since I interminably track down all activities done by you (my Trojan virus controls all processes remotely, just as TeamViewer).\n&gt; That your videos will be distributed, even though you have completed money transfer to my wallet.\nTrust me, it is worthless for me to still bother you after money transfer is successful. Moreover, if that was ever part of my plan, I would do make it happen way earlier!\n\nWe are going to approach and deal with it in a clear manner.\nBye.\n",

        "description": "\nHi. How are you?\n\nI know, it\u2019s unpleasant to start the conversation with bad news, but I have no choice.\nFew months ago, I have gained access to your devices that used by you for internet browsing.\nAfterwards, I could track down all your internet activities.\n\nHere is the history of how it could become possible:\nAt first, I purchased from hackers the access to multiple email accounts (nowadays, it is a really simple thing to do online).\nAs result, I could easily log in to your email account [email\u00a0protected].\n\nOne week later, I installed Trojan virus in Operating Systems of all devices of yours, which you use to open email.\nFrankly speaking, it was rather straightforward (since you were opening the links from your inbox emails).\nEverything ingenious is quite simple. (o_0)!\n\nMy software enables me with access to all controllers inside devices of yours, like microphone, keyboard and video camera.\nI could easily download to my servers all your private info, including the history of web browsing and photos.\nI can effortlessly gain access to all your messengers, social networks accounts, emails, contact list as well as chat history.\nVirus of mine constantly keeps refreshing its signatures (because it is driver-based), and as result remains unnoticed by your antivirus.\n\nHence, you can already guess why I stayed undetected all this while.\n\nAs I was gathering information about you, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that you are also a true fan of adult-content websites.\nYou actually love visiting porn sites and browsing through kinky videos, while pleasuring yourself.\nI could make a few dirty records with you in the main focus and montaged several videos showing the way you reach orgasm while masturbating with joy.\n\nIf you are still uncertain regarding the seriousness of my intentions,\nit only requires several mouse clicks for me to forward your videos to all your relatives, as well as friends and colleagues.\nI can also make those vids become accessible by public.\nI honestly think that you do not really want that to happen, considering the peculiarity of videos you like to watch,\n(you obviously know what I mean) all that kinky content can become a reason of serious troubles for you.\n\nHowever, we can still resolve this situation in the following manner:\nEverything you are required to do is a single transfer of $990 USD to my account (or amount equivalent to bitcoin depending on exchange rate at the moment of transfer),\nand once the transaction is complete, I will straight away remove all the dirty content exposing you.\nAfter that, you can even forget that you have come across me. Moreover, I swear that all the harmful software will be removed from all devices of yours as well.\nMake no doubt that I will fulfill my part.\n\nThis is really a great deal that comes at a reasonable price, given that I have used quite a lot of energy to check your profile as well as traffic over an extended period of time.\nIf you have no idea about bitcoin purchase process \u2013 it can be straightforwardly done by getting all the necessary information online.\n\nHere is my bitcoin wallet provided below: bc1q73lm30rgv6h9wy42y88t0r8prjh9l9pzpvvm9c\n\nYou should complete the abovementioned transfer within 48 hours (2 days) after opening this email.\n\nThe following list contains actions you should avoid attempting:\n#Do not try calling police as well as other security forces. In addition, abstain from sharing this story with your friends.\nAfter I find out (be sure, I can easily do that, given that I keep complete control of all your devices) \u2013 your kinky video will end up being available to public right away.\n#Do not try searching for me \u2013 there is absolutely no reason to do that. Moreover, all transactions in cryptocurrency are always anonymous.\n#Do not try reinstalling the OS on your devices or throwing them away. It is pointless as well, since all your videos have already been uploaded to remote servers.\n\nThe following list contains things you should not be worried about:\n#That your money won\u2019t reach my account.\n\u2013 Rest assured, the transactions can be tracked, hence once the transaction is complete,\nI will know about it, because I continuously observe all your activities (my trojan virus allows me to control remotely your devices, same as TeamViewer).\n#That I still will share your kinky videos to public after you complete money transfer.\n\u2013 Trust me, it\u2019s pointless for me to continue troubling your life. If I really wanted, I would make it happen already!\n\nLet\u2019s make this deal in a fair manner!\n\nOwh, one more thing\u2026in future it is best that you don\u2019t involve yourself in similar situations any longer!\nOne last advice from me \u2013 recurrently change all your passwords from all accounts\n",
